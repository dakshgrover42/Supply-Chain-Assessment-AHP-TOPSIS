# Supplier-Selection-AHP-TOPSIS

📦 **Hybrid MCDM for Retail Supply Chains**
This project uses AHP and TOPSIS to identify, weight, and rank critical supply chain challenges faced by retailers during the COVID‑19 pandemic, guiding managers toward data‑driven solution prioritization.

✅ **Project Objectives**
🎯 List and describe 11 real‑world supply chain challenges
⚖️ Compute criterion weights through AHP pairwise comparisons
📊 Rank challenges by performance scores via TOPSIS
🔍 Deliver clear, actionable prioritization insights

🗂 **Key Steps & Workflow**

1. **Define Challenges & Criteria**

   * Eleven issues (e.g., demand swings, safety, communication gaps)
   * Seven performance criteria impacting decision making

2. **AHP Weighting Process**

   * Build pairwise comparison matrices from expert judgments
   * Normalize matrices & calculate weights
   * Verify consistency ratio for reliability

3. **TOPSIS Ranking Process**

   * Translate qualitative ratings into quantitative scores
   * Construct and normalize the decision matrix
   * Apply AHP‑derived weights to create weighted matrix
   * Compute distance to ideal best and ideal worst
   * Calculate performance scores and rank challenges

4. **Results & Visualization**

   * Ordered list of challenges by TOPSIS score
   * Top priorities: Consumer Attitude & Access Constraints
   * Visualized findings with bar charts and performance plots

🧾 **Conclusion**
AHP–TOPSIS offers a transparent, reproducible framework for prioritizing supply chain challenges under uncertainty, enabling managers to allocate limited resources effectively.
